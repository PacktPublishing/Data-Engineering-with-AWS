# Chapter 5 - Architecting Data Engineering Pipelines

In this chapter, we reviewed an approach to developing data engineering pipelines by
identifying a limited-scope project, and then whiteboarding a high-level architecture
diagram. We looked at how we could have a workshop, in conjunction with relevant
stakeholders in the organization, to discuss requirements and plan the initial architecture.

## Hands-on Activity
In the ***hands-on activity*** section of this chapter, we read through some fictional notes of a meeting to discuss a new project that had specific data requirements. As we read through the notes, we sketched out a high-level whiteboard architecture showing data consumers, data ingestion sources, and transformations.
